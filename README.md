## Is this working?

Hello. This is me. Call me Ezio Hikari.  
I'm just another person on the internet.

### My GitHub

My GitHub account is meant for as a user.  
I only contribute assimilated data, minor error fixes, and at times raise issues for bugs or suggestions.  
Otherwise, this account is only for following projects and downloading compiled files/programs.

### Coding

I cannot code anything besides (basic) HTML and CSS yet.  
I want to learn but I'm lazy and usually busy.

### Affiliations

I am a team member of **[Vignette](https://github.com/vignetteapp)**, an open-source vtuber toolkit.  
I am also the Lead Story Writer and head of the Writing Team of **[Iridescent World](https://twitter.com/iw_game)**, a vtuber gacha game.

### Personal

I am active on Discord but I'm not giving away my tag.
My [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eeezoo0) DMs are open for any writing commissions.
